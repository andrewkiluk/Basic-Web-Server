Lab 7

The web server works as specified. I changed the row colors to rotate among 3 colors when giving
mdb-lookup results, for no good reason. 

I got the server to respond well to requests for directories, whether or not they end in '/', 
by using a redirect method. 

This was a lot of fun! And I'd been meaning to make a terrible TNG fanpage anyway, so this lab 
was very practical.
